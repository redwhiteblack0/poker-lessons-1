# Poker Lessons | Homework #1 - Pot Odds

## Review

We saw how pot odds are used as an indicator to decide if we should call an opponent's bet or not. In the case where Villain makes a half pot bet, we know that we should only continue when we have at least 25% equity against their betting range and should fold otherwise (in some, but not all, cases at least). 

The goal of this homework is to give you practice calculating pot odds and to explore equity calcultation tools which will be used for study away from the table. Additionally, this homework will ask you to think critically about scenarios where pot odds may not be such a reliable indicator and to get you thinking about the wider world of poker strategy.

## Problems

### Section 1: Simple Exercises
- You are in the Big Blind and the flop comes `AhJc6d`. The current pot is 100bb. Villain is in the Small Blind and bets 25bb into the current pot. If you decide to make the call, what are your pot odds? Express both in terms of a percentage and as a ratio.

- You are in the Big Blind again and the flop comes `6c6hKd`. The current pot is 100bb. Villain is in the Small Blind again and bets 150bb into the current pot. If you decide to make the call, what are your pot odds? Write as both a percentage and ratio.

- The roles have reversed and you are in the Small Blind. The flop is `2d4sJc`. You decide that this is a good spot to bet and so you bet 250bb into a pot of 100bb. What are the pot odds that you are giving your opponent? What percentage of the pot would they own if they decided to call? 

- You are in the Small Blind again and the current pot is 100bb. The flop is irrelvant, but you like it so you decide to bet 10bb. Your opponent in the Big Blind lets out a soft grunt, surprised that you would bet such a small amount. What percentage of the pot are you claiming to own here? And what are the pot odds that you're giving your opponent?

- Two players are heads up and you're watching. Player 1 makes a bet of 5bb into a pot of 100bb on the flop. Player 2 calls. Now the turn comes and Player 1 makes another bet of 5bb into the current pot. What pot odds does Player 2 have if he decides to call this new bet on the turn?

### Section 2: More Complex Scenarios

- You are in the Big Blind and the flop comes `9h2d4s`. Your opponent in the Small Blind bets 75bb into a 67bb pot. What are your pot odds? Here, you should only write percentages as a ratio will be useless here.

- Same situation as above, but the pot is 275bb and your opponent bets 33bb. What percentage of the pot do you need to own in order to continue?

- Now, a new situation: You are in the Hijack and are facing a Villain on the Button. Everyone else folds. The total pot on the flop is 7.5bb. You see a flop of `Ad5d2s`. You like this flop and want to keep your opponent in the pot so you bet 2.5bb. Now, instead of calling you, your opoonent raises to 7.5bb. So, first, what is the total size of the pot after villain's raise? How much do you need to bet in order to remain in the hand? If you do call the raise, what are your pot odds?

- You won the last hand using your excellent knowledge of pot odds and Villain is now out for blood. This time you're on the Button and he's UTG. He raises 6bb preflop and everyone in between folds. You call his bet and the blinds fold too. The flop comes `Ks3c8h`. Your opponent bets 100% of the pot. You raise to 2x his bet. He raises to 3x your raise. What are your pot odds to call? (Try to break this problem down into steps: 1. What is the total pot size before the flop? Did you remember to count the blinds as well? 2. What is the total size of the pot after you raise your opponent? 3. Now what is the total size of the pot after Villain reraises? 4. How much do you need to call in order to continue?)

- Well, you took down the last pot with superior poker skill (and a lucky river, of course). Your opponent is tilted. Time to go for the kill. You are in MP and open raise to 2.3bb. Villain is in the Small Blind. Everyone in between you and Villain folds and the Big Blind folds as well. Villain, raises preflop to 6x your original bet. You call. Now the flop comes and you don't care what it is. All you know, is that it's time to take him down. Since your opponent is in the Small Blind, he goes first post-flop. He checks. Surprised, you bet 50% pot. Villain just calls. The turn comes and it's a brick. Opponent checks again. You decide you can't stop betting now so you again bet 50% of the pot. Your opponent calls. Now we go to the river. It's an Ace. Opponent checks once more. You know that he's tilted and could be playing any two cards here so an Ace is good for you. You bet 50% of the pot for a third time. Opponent thinks for a few moments, looks at his cards, and then check-raises you for a 233% overbet. You're shocked. But you keep your cool and calculate. What are your pot odds here? What is the minimum amount of equity you need to make the call? What were the pot odds on the turn? What about the flop? How do your odds change on each street - do they even change at all? Again, take your time with this one. Go through each round of betting and calculate the total pot size and pot odds for both players at every stage. And don't forget to count the money automatically out in the pot by the blinds!   

### Section 3: Creating a Table for Reference

- It's time for a break from the last examples. This will be more straightforward. I want you to construct a table similar to this one below:

![alt text](https://blog.gtowizard.com/wp-content/uploads/cheat-sheet.png)

I want you to just focus on the first two columns, so you only have to worry about the first two columns - the Bet Size and the Pot Odds - everything else you can ignore (we'll talk about those in future lessons!).

So your job is to fill in the right hand column for this table. The Bet Size in the right column is the percentage relative to the size of the pot. So a 50% bet into a 100bb pot is 50bb, etc.

| Bet Size | Pot Odds      | 
|----------|:-------------:|
| 5%       |               |
| 10%      |               |
| 20%      |               |
| 25%      |               |
| 33%      |               |
| 50%      |               |
| 66%      |               |
| 75%      |               |
| 100%     |               |
| 125%     |               |
| 150%     |               |
| 200%     |               |
| 225%     |               |
| 250%     |               |
| 275%     |               |
| 300%     |               |

You will use this table as a reference when playing in your games until you get more of a feel for pot odds. So I want you to play some fake money games and look at your opponents' bet sizes relative to the size of the pot and then look at this table and see what your pot odds will be in the scenario. Don't worry about timing out when you play like this. It's all for fake money so don't take winning too seriously. Instead, focus on seeing your pot odds in a wide variety of scenarios. You can keep it simple at first and only use the table when you're calling a bet. But when you feel more adventurous, feel free to do the same vs raises as well. Put those problems in section 2 to good use!

### Section 4: Thought Experiments

- You've probably seen some common bet sizes being used by now. For instance, usually players in my games have default bet sizes of 33%, 50%, 66%, 75%, and 125% on the flop. What are these common bet sizes in your games? Are they close to the values in your table? If you don't see the patterns yet, play more hands and take mental notes! You'll see them eventually.

 Now that you have a list of those bet sizes, what are the typical odds opponents are offering? Do you think there might be a reason that they are offering these odds specifically? Do you notice that opponents change their bet size when the board changes on the flop? Will they bet bigger or smaller when there's an Ace on the flop? What about a flush draw? And paired boards? Why do you think players change their bet sizes based on the flop? Now what about the turn? And the river?

 Write down some data! Let's get some hand histories to analyze!

 - In our lesson we discussed the possibility of continuing to play when we have less equity than necessary to continue based on pot odds. What kind of boards do we continue on - that is, what do the cards on the flop look like when we keep playing this way? What do you think you'd do if you're playing a flush draw and the turn does nothing to improve you? What about the river when your draw misses? Should you pay more attention to pot odds on later streets? If so, why? 

 What about when you have a strong made hand like top 2-pair and better? Do you think your opponent is giving you too good of odds when they bet large into you? What if they only bet large when they have a strong hand as well? Do you think this will affect our decision to continue? What about when we have the nuts (or the near nuts)?

 - We also talked about the concept of opponents losing value when they bet in such a way that their bet size allows us to continue with more equity than the pot odds offered. Since we have so much more equity, do you think there's any way to extract more value from our opponents? Should we start to raise them at any point? Or maybe we should widen our range? What are the pros and cons of each approach?

 - Lastly, you may have noticed that pot odds after facing a raise are different than when deciding to call. How are they different? With this in mind, what does a raise do to your opponents odds? When Villain raises too frequently, should we call more often or should we tighten up our range against them? How do you think their own odds change when they raise? Is there possibly something we're missing here to make up for the extra value a raise implies?
